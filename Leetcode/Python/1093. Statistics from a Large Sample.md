```
We sampled integers between 0 and 255, and stored the results in an array count:  count[k] is the number of integers we sampled equal to k.

Return the minimum, maximum, mean, median, and mode of the sample respectively, as an array of floating point numbers.  The mode is guaranteed to be unique.

(Recall that the median of a sample is:

The middle element, if the elements of the sample were sorted and the number of elements is odd;
The average of the middle two elements, if the elements of the sample were sorted and the number of elements is even.)
 

Example 1:

Input: count = [0,1,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: [1.00000,3.00000,2.37500,2.50000,3.00000]
Example 2:

Input: count = [0,4,3,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: [1.00000,4.00000,2.18182,2.00000,1.00000]
 

Constraints:

count.length == 256
1 <= sum(count) <= 10^9
The mode of the sample that count represents is unique.
Answers within 10^-5 of the true value will be accepted as correct.

直接来搞一个前缀和算median，其他的都很简单

```python
class Solution:
    def sampleStats(self, count: List[int]) -> List[float]:
        minn, maxx = float('inf'), -float('inf')
        mean = median = mode = sums = max_cnt = 0
        
        sum_cnt = sum(count)
        pref = []
        for i, cnt in enumerate(count):
            if pref:
                pref.append(cnt + pref[-1])
            else:
                pref.append(cnt)
                
        if sum_cnt % 2 == 0:
            for i, cnt in enumerate(pref):
                if cnt < sum_cnt // 2:
                    continue
                elif cnt == sum_cnt // 2:
                    median = (i + i + 1) / 2
                    break
                else:
                    median = i
                    break
        else:
            for i, cnt in enumerate(pref):
                if cnt < sum_cnt // 2 + 1:
                    continue
                else:
                    median = i
                    break

        for i, cnt in enumerate(count):
            sums += i * cnt
            if cnt != 0:
                minn = min(i, minn)
                maxx = max(i, maxx)
            if cnt > max_cnt:
                mode = i
                max_cnt = cnt
        return [minn * 1.0, maxx * 1.0, sums / sum_cnt * 1.0, median * 1.0, mode * 1.0]
```
