```
Write a program that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to n.

But for multiples of three it should output “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five output “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five output “FizzBuzz”.

Example:

n = 15,

Return:
[
    "1",
    "2",
    "Fizz",
    "4",
    "Buzz",
    "Fizz",
    "7",
    "8",
    "Fizz",
    "Buzz",
    "11",
    "Fizz",
    "13",
    "14",
    "FizzBuzz"
]
```

一行
```python
class Solution(object):
    def fizzBuzz(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        return [(not i%3)*"Fizz" + (not i%5)*"Buzz" or str(i) for i in range(1, n+1)]

```
```python
class Solution(object):
    def fizzBuzz(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        return [str(i) if (i%3!=0 and i%5!=0) else (('Fizz'*(i%3==0)) + ('Buzz'*(i%5==0))) for i in range(1,n+1)]

```


就是easy，不过可以参见这里，有一些讨论

我觉得这里一个用yield的想法还蛮不错
```
# the fizbuz logic, returns an iterator object that
# calculates one value at a time, not all ot them at once
def fiz(numbers):
    for i in numbers:
        if i % 15 == 0:
            yield 'fizbuz'
        elif i % 5 == 0:
            yield 'buz'
        elif i % 3 == 0:
            yield 'fiz'
        else:
            yield str(i)

# xrange evaluates lazily, good for big numbers
# matches well with the lazy-eval generator function
numbers = xrange(1,2**20)

# this gets one number, turns that one number into fuz, repeat
print ' '.join(fiz(numbers))

# returns: 1 2 fiz 4 buz fiz [...] fiz 1048573 1048574 fizbuz
```
- clearly separates fizbuz logic from concatenation
- is as plain and readeable as possible
- generator iterator does not keep all the array in memory
- so that you can do it on arbitrary numbers (see Euler problem #10)

What I do not like in this solution is the three ifs, whereas the problem can be solved with two.

Answer: because yield is efficient when you do not want to keep big arrays in memory just to iterate through them. But this question is not about big arrays.
