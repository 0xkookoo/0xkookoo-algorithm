```
Given a list of scores of different students, return the average score of each student's top five scores in the order of each student's id.

Each entry items[i] has items[i][0] the student's id, and items[i][1] the student's score.  The average score is calculated using integer division.

 

Example 1:

Input: [[1,91],[1,92],[2,93],[2,97],[1,60],[2,77],[1,65],[1,87],[1,100],[2,100],[2,76]]
Output: [[1,87],[2,88]]
Explanation: 
The average of the student with id = 1 is 87.
The average of the student with id = 2 is 88.6. But with integer division their average converts to 88.
 

Note:

1 <= items.length <= 1000
items[i].length == 2
The IDs of the students is between 1 to 1000
The score of the students is between 1 to 100
For each student, there are at least 5 scores```

******- 时间复杂度: O(NlgN)******- 空间复杂度: O(N)******

对于每一个id的分数搞一个heap即可

最坏情况全都是一个人的成绩



```python
from heapq import *


class Solution:
    def highFive(self, items: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        lookup = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for i, s in items:
            if len(lookup[i]) == 0:
                lookup[i].append(-s)
                heapify(lookup[i])
            else:
                heappush(lookup[i], -s)
        res = []
        for i in sorted(list(lookup.keys())):
            tmp = -(heappop(lookup[i]) + heappop(lookup[i]) + heappop(lookup[i]) + heappop(lookup[i]) + heappop(lookup[i])) // 5
            res.append([i, tmp])
        return res
```
