> 内容描述

```
You are given an array of strings words and a string chars.

A string is good if it can be formed by characters from chars (each character can only be used once).

Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in words.

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.
Example 2:

Input: words = ["hello","world","leetcode"], chars = "welldonehoneyr"
Output: 10
Explanation: 
The strings that can be formed are "hello" and "world" so the answer is 5 + 5 = 10.
 

Note:

1 <= words.length <= 1000
1 <= words[i].length, chars.length <= 100
All strings contain lowercase English letters only.
```

直接cnt一下每个字符出现的次数，然后每个单词比较一下，如果可以组成就把长度加到最终结果去

```python
class Solution:
    def countCharacters(self, words: List[str], chars: str) -> int:
        cnt = collections.Counter(chars)
        def can(cnt, w):
            tmp = collections.Counter(w)
            for k, v in tmp.items():
                if v > cnt[k]:
                    return False
            return True
        return sum(len(w) for w in words if can(cnt, w))
```
