```
Given a list of points that form a polygon when joined sequentially, find if this polygon is convex (Convex polygon definition).

 

Note:

There are at least 3 and at most 10,000 points.
Coordinates are in the range -10,000 to 10,000.
You may assume the polygon formed by given points is always a simple polygon (Simple polygon definition). In other words, we ensure that exactly two edges intersect at each vertex, and that edges otherwise don't intersect each other.
 

Example 1:

[[0,0],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0]]

Answer: True

Explanation:
Example 2:

[[0,0],[0,10],[10,10],[10,0],[5,5]]

Answer: False

Explanation:

- The polygon is entirely contained in a closed half-plane defined by each of its edges.

如果这个多边形的每两条连续的边之间的点积要么全是正数，要么全是负数，那么这个多边形就是凸多边形：

class Solution:
    def isConvex(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        z_cross_product = None

        for i in range(-2, len(points)-2): # 要判断所有连续的两条边，自然需要包括首尾
            x = [points[i][0], points[i+1][0], points[i+2][0]]
            y = [points[i][1], points[i+1][1], points[i+2][1]]

            dx1, dy1 = x[1] - x[0], y[1] - y[0]
            dx2, dy2 = x[2] - x[1], y[2] - y[1]

            if not z_cross_product:
                z_cross_product = dx1 * dy2 - dy1 * dx2
            elif (dx1 * dy2 - dy1 * dx2) * z_cross_product < 0:
                return False
        return True
