> 内容描述

```
In a social group, there are N people, with unique integer ids from 0 to N-1.

We have a list of logs, where each logs[i] = [timestamp, id_A, id_B] contains a non-negative integer timestamp, and the ids of two different people.

Each log represents the time in which two different people became friends.  Friendship is symmetric: if A is friends with B, then B is friends with A.

Let's say that person A is acquainted with person B if A is friends with B, or A is a friend of someone acquainted with B.

Return the earliest time for which every person became acquainted with every other person. Return -1 if there is no such earliest time.

 

Example 1:

Input: logs = [[20190101,0,1],[20190104,3,4],[20190107,2,3],[20190211,1,5],[20190224,2,4],[20190301,0,3],[20190312,1,2],[20190322,4,5]], N = 6
Output: 20190301
Explanation: 
The first event occurs at timestamp = 20190101 and after 0 and 1 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3], [4], [5].
The second event occurs at timestamp = 20190104 and after 3 and 4 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3,4], [5].
The third event occurs at timestamp = 20190107 and after 2 and 3 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2,3,4], [5].
The fourth event occurs at timestamp = 20190211 and after 1 and 5 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1,5], [2,3,4].
The fifth event occurs at timestamp = 20190224 and as 2 and 4 are already friend anything happens.
The sixth event occurs at timestamp = 20190301 and after 0 and 3 become friends we have that all become friends.
 

Note:

1 <= N <= 100
1 <= logs.length <= 10^4
0 <= logs[i][0] <= 10^9
0 <= logs[i][1], logs[i][2] <= N - 1
It's guaranteed that all timestamps in logs[i][0] are different.
Logs are not necessarily ordered by some criteria.
logs[i][1] != logs[i][2]
```

> 思路 1
******- 时间复杂度: O(max(LlgL, L*N))******- 空间复杂度: O(N)******

并查集，先把log按照时间排序，然后一个一个放uf里面，直到所有的person都被连接起来了的时候就可以返回当前的timestamp了，如果最后都没有满足的话，那就返回-1

```python
class UnionFind(object):
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.count = n
        self.uf = [i for i in range(n)]
        self.size = [1] * n

    def find(self, x):
        while x != self.uf[x]:
            self.uf[x] = self.uf[self.uf[x]]
            x = self.uf[x]
        return self.uf[x]

    def union(self, x, y):
        x_root = self.find(x)
        y_root = self.find(y)
        if x_root == y_root:
            return
        if self.size[x_root] < self.size[y_root]:
            x_root, y_root = y_root, x_root
        self.uf[y_root] = x_root
        self.size[x_root] += self.size[y_root]
        self.size[y_root] = 0
        self.count -= 1


class Solution:
    def earliestAcq(self, logs: List[List[int]], N: int) -> int:
        uf = UnionFind(N)
        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        for log, a, b in logs:
            uf.union(a, b)
            if uf.count == 1:
                return log
        return -1
