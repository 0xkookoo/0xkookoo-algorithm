```
On a campus represented as a 2D grid, there are N workers and M bikes, with N <= M. Each worker and bike is a 2D coordinate on this grid.

We assign one unique bike to each worker so that the sum of the Manhattan distances between each worker and their assigned bike is minimized.

The Manhattan distance between two points p1 and p2 is Manhattan(p1, p2) = |p1.x - p2.x| + |p1.y - p2.y|.

Return the minimum possible sum of Manhattan distances between each worker and their assigned bike.

 

Example 1:



Input: workers = [[0,0],[2,1]], bikes = [[1,2],[3,3]]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
We assign bike 0 to worker 0, bike 1 to worker 1. The Manhattan distance of both assignments is 3, so the output is 6.
Example 2:



Input: workers = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0]], bikes = [[1,0],[2,2],[2,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
We first assign bike 0 to worker 0, then assign bike 1 to worker 1 or worker 2, bike 2 to worker 2 or worker 1. Both assignments lead to sum of the Manhattan distances as 4.
 

Note:

0 <= workers[i][0], workers[i][1], bikes[i][0], bikes[i][1] < 1000
All worker and bike locations are distinct.
1 <= workers.length <= bikes.length <= 10
```

******- 时间复杂度: O(N！)******- 空间复杂度: O(2^N)******

穷举+cache

时间复杂度中的N是bikes的长度

- x中的每一位为1代表当前bike还未被分配，为0代表被分配了
- idx代表正在分配第idx+1个worker
- dp[x]代表bikes分配状态为x的情况下所能产生的最小sum

```python
class Solution:
    def assignBikes(self, workers: List[List[int]], bikes: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        self.dp = [-1] * (1 << 10)

        def getDp(x, w, b, idx):
            if idx == len(w):
                return 0
            if self.dp[x] != -1:
                return self.dp[x]
            self.dp[x] = float('inf')
            for i in range(len(bikes)):
                if x & (1 << i):
                    tmp = getDp(x - (1 << i), w, b, idx + 1) + abs(w[idx][0] - b[i][0]) + abs(w[idx][1] - b[i][1])
                    self.dp[x] = min(self.dp[x], tmp)
            return self.dp[x]

        return getDp((1 << len(bikes)) - 1, workers, bikes, 0)
```
