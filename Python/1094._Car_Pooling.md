> 内容描述

```
You are driving a vehicle that has capacity empty seats initially available for passengers.  The vehicle only drives east (ie. it cannot turn around and drive west.)

Given a list of trips, trip[i] = [num_passengers, start_location, end_location] contains information about the i-th trip: the number of passengers that must be picked up, and the locations to pick them up and drop them off.  The locations are given as the number of kilometers due east from your vehicle's initial location.

Return true if and only if it is possible to pick up and drop off all passengers for all the given trips. 

 

Example 1:

Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 4
Output: false
Example 2:

Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 5
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,5,7]], capacity = 3
Output: true
Example 4:

Input: trips = [[3,2,7],[3,7,9],[8,3,9]], capacity = 11
Output: true
 
 

Constraints:

trips.length <= 1000
trips[i].length == 3
1 <= trips[i][0] <= 100
0 <= trips[i][1] < trips[i][2] <= 1000
1 <= capacity <= 100000
```

> 思路 1
******- 时间复杂度: O(N^2)******- 空间复杂度: O(1)******

算一下每个时刻车上的人，看任意时刻是否有人数大于capacity 的时候即可
```python
class Solution:
    def carPooling(self, trips: List[List[int]], capacity: int) -> bool:
        d = [0] * 1001
        for n, s, e in trips:
            for i in range(s, e):
                d[i] += n
        return max(d) <= capacity
```


> 思路 2
******- 时间复杂度: O(N)******- 空间复杂度: O(1)******

刚才是不停的加上去，现在我们直接用capacity 来减，这样更省时间

```python
class Solution:
    def carPooling(self, trips: List[List[int]], capacity: int) -> bool:
        d = [0] * 1001
        for n, s, e in trips:
            d[s] += n
            d[e] -= n
        for i in range(len(d)):
            capacity -= d[i]
            if capacity < 0:
                return False
        return True
```
