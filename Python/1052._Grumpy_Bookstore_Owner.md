> 内容描述

```
Today, the bookstore owner has a store open for customers.length minutes.  Every minute, some number of customers (customers[i]) enter the store, and all those customers leave after the end of that minute.

On some minutes, the bookstore owner is grumpy.  If the bookstore owner is grumpy on the i-th minute, grumpy[i] = 1, otherwise grumpy[i] = 0.  When the bookstore owner is grumpy, the customers of that minute are not satisfied, otherwise they are satisfied.

The bookstore owner knows a secret technique to keep themselves not grumpy for X minutes straight, but can only use it once.

Return the maximum number of customers that can be satisfied throughout the day.

 

Example 1:

Input: customers = [1,0,1,2,1,1,7,5], grumpy = [0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1], X = 3
Output: 16
Explanation: The bookstore owner keeps themselves not grumpy for the last 3 minutes. 
The maximum number of customers that can be satisfied = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 7 + 5 = 16.
 

Note:

1 <= X <= customers.length == grumpy.length <= 20000
0 <= customers[i] <= 1000
0 <= grumpy[i] <= 1
```

> 思路 1
******- 时间复杂度: O(N)******- 空间复杂度: O(1)******

先把grumpy为0的customer全部加上，然后对于grumpy为1的customer我们来做一个双指针，只要我们横跨的时间没有超过X，我们就就可以一直叠加上grumpy为1的
customer，最后求出区间为X的widnow里面使得grumpy从1变为0最多可以增加的customer为多少之后，我们把它加到最终结果里面去即可

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSatisfied(self, customers: List[int], grumpy: List[int], X: int) -> int:
        res = sum(customers[i] for i in range(len(grumpy)) if grumpy[i] == 0)
        i, j, tmp, maxx = 0, 0, 0, 0
        while j < len(grumpy):
            if grumpy[j] == 1:
                tmp += customers[j]
            while j - i + 1 > X:
                if grumpy[i] == 1:
                    tmp -= customers[i]
                i += 1
            j += 1
            maxx = max(maxx, tmp)
        return res + maxx
