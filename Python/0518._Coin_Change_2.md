******- 时间复杂度: O(C * amount)******- 空间复杂度: O(amount)******

dp[i]代表要凑够i块钱有多少种组合方法

```dp[i] += dp[i-coin] for coin in coins```

这个[视频](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change-2/discuss/99222/Video-explaining-how-dynamic-programming-works-with-the-Coin-Change-problem)说的还不错

特别是其中的一个评论很有用

Great video, thanks for uploading. 
I think one thing you didn't explain is that why the outer loop is the coins, not the amount. 
The reason behind that is that as you mentioned, the problem is to find the total number of combinations, 
not the permutations. 
If the outer loop is the amount, 
then the same combination will be counted multiple times because they can come in in different orders. 
By letting the coins to be the outer loops, one assures that for any valid combination, 
the order of each coin will always be the same as their order in coins, so there can be no duplicates.
```

```python
class Solution:
    def change(self, amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [0] * (amount+1)
        dp[0] = 1
        # coins = set(coins) # 个人觉得这一行是有必要的
        for coin in coins:
            for i in range(1, amount+1):
                if i - coin >= 0:
                    dp[i] += dp[i-coin]
        return dp[-1]
```


coin change 2这题题目没有说给的coin没有duplicate吧，我觉得有必要去一下重？不然答案就不对了，对于同一种coin dp加了两遍


OJ 的solution对于case amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5] 给出的答案是5，其实是错的，应该还是4才对

总感觉读题目意思没有明确说明，虽然说了different，但是没有说coin 两两different，是我太谨慎了。。
