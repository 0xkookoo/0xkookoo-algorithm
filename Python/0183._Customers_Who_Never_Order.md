SQL Schema
Suppose that a website contains two tables, the Customers table and the Orders table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.

Table: Customers.

| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |

Table: Orders.

| Id | CustomerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
