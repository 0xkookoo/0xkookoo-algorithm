```
You want to schedule a list of jobs in d days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the i-th job, you have to finish all the jobs j where 0 <= j < i).

You have to finish at least one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the d days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done in that day.

Given an array of integers jobDifficulty and an integer d. The difficulty of the i-th job is jobDifficulty[i].

Return the minimum difficulty of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return -1.

 

Example 1:


Input: jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, total difficulty = 6.
Second day you can finish the last job, total difficulty = 1.
The difficulty of the schedule = 6 + 1 = 7 
Example 2:

Input: jobDifficulty = [9,9,9], d = 4
Output: -1
Explanation: If you finish a job per day you will still have a free day. you cannot find a schedule for the given jobs.
Example 3:

Input: jobDifficulty = [1,1,1], d = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The schedule is one job per day. total difficulty will be 3.
Example 4:

Input: jobDifficulty = [7,1,7,1,7,1], d = 3
Output: 15
Example 5:

Input: jobDifficulty = [11,111,22,222,33,333,44,444], d = 6
Output: 843
 

Constraints:

1 <= jobDifficulty.length <= 300
0 <= jobDifficulty[i] <= 1000
1 <= d <= 10
```

dfs(i, d) 代表我们目前已经完成了前i-1个job，还剩下d天让我们完成剩下的(n-i+1)个任务，然后我们还需要至少多少difficulty来完成。

```python
import functools

class Solution:
    def minDifficulty(self, jd: List[int], d: int) -> int:
        n = len(jd)
        if n < d:
            return -1
        
        @functools.lru_cache(None)
        def dfs(i, d):
            if d == 1:
                return max(jd[i:])
            res = float('inf')
            for j in range(i, n-d+1):
                res = min(res, max(jd[i:j+1]) + dfs(j+1, d-1))
            return res
        
        return dfs(0, d)
```
