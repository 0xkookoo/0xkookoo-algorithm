Since the limit is 10^9 we can find closest 2 numbers who's product is either num+1 or num+2 by iterating over all numbers and finding the possible combination/factor.
The key is that we only need to traverse from sqrt(num+2) and sqrt(num+1) and check find the closest factor pair.

The reason for doing it from sqrt is that the factors start repeating in the reverse order after the square root.
eg: 100
The table produced is:
```
1*100    ^
2*50     |
4*25     |
5*20     |  (Increasing distance as we go up)
10*10 <- sqrt, we see repetitions after this point (Also notice this is the closest)
20*5 
25*4 
2*50 
100*1
```

```python
class Solution:
    def closestDivisors(self, num: int) -> List[int]:
        n1, n2 = num + 1, num + 2
        minn = float('inf')
        res = []
        # 从sqrt(n2)开始往下找，一旦找到立马就return，因为距离中间越近，差越小
        for i in range(int(math.sqrt(n2)) + 1, 0, -1): 
            if n2 % i == 0:
                res = [i, n2 // i]
                minn = n2 // i - i
                break
        for i in range(int(math.sqrt(n1)) + 1, 0, -1): 
            if n1 % i == 0 and n1 // i - i < minn:
                res = [i, n1 // i]
                break
        return res
```
