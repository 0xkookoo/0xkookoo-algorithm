```
Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.

You need to help them find out their common interest with the least list index sum. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.

Example 1:
Input:
["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
["Piatti", "The Grill at Torrey Pines", "Hungry Hunter Steakhouse", "Shogun"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The only restaurant they both like is "Shogun".
Example 2:
Input:
["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
["KFC", "Shogun", "Burger King"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum 1 (0+1).
Note:
The length of both lists will be in the range of [1, 1000].
The length of strings in both lists will be in the range of [1, 30].
The index is starting from 0 to the list length minus 1.
No duplicates in both lists.
```

一次遍历即可, 最需要注意的就是我们的答案可能会有好几个，我们需要用一个list一起返回

```python
class Solution:
    def findRestaurant(self, list1: List[str], list2: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        lookup1, lookup2 = {}, {}
        for i, r in enumerate(list1):
            lookup1[r] = i
        for i, r in enumerate(list2):
            lookup2[r] = i
        res, minn = [], float('inf')
        for r in list1:
            if r in lookup2:
                if lookup1[r] + lookup2[r] < minn:
                    minn = lookup1[r] + lookup2[r]
                    res = [r]
                elif lookup1[r] + lookup2[r] == minn:
                    res.append(r)
        return res
```
