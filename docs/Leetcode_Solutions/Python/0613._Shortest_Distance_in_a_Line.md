```
Table point holds the x coordinate of some points on x-axis in a plane, which are all integers.
Write a query to find the shortest distance between two points in these points.
| x   |
|-----|
| -1  |
| 0   |
| 2   |
The shortest distance is '1' obviously, which is from point '-1' to '0'. So the output is as below:
| shortest|
|---------|
| 1       |
Note: Every point is unique, which means there is no duplicates in table point.
Follow-up: What if all these points have an id and are arranged from the left most to the right most of x axis?
```

## 解题方案

> 思路 1

```sql
select min(abs(p1.x-p2.x)) as shortest from point p1, point p2 where p1.x != p2.x;
```

> 思路 2

```sql
select min(p2.x-p1.x) shortest from point p1 inner join point p2 where p2.x > p1.x;
```
